# refugee-phone-installation
This is an app that should come pre-installed on all Refugee phones. It gives the user a list of good resources that are useful for them when first arriving to Sweden. These can be things such as a facebook-page, a youtube-video or a another app that can help them. It also have a news segment that is linked to refugeephones.com so that they can publish news such as access to public WiFi-hotspots.

# Instructions

## How to post news
The news section downloads data via an rss feed from http://www.refugeephones.com/news?format=rss
If they post with squarespace a new post on their news page then this rss will be updated.

## How to change/add new resources
There are some json-file's on Google Drive that needs to be changed. These should have been shared with refugeephones so that they can access them via their own Google Drive. Otherwise contact Niels untill resolved.

## Download
A binary apk that should be able to be installed can be found here on the github page
